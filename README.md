# Cracking The Coding Interview

This playground is a collection of solutions to some of the exercises in this book:

## [Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1437988505&sr=8-2&keywords=cracking+the+code+interview)

## Notes
All written in Swift 2.0.
Tested on Xcode 7.0 beta 3.
Each chapter is included as a Swift module file.

The list of exercises is incomplete and the solutions are entirely my own, rather than a port of the ones in the book. Some solutions may be wrong and there is some work to be done in updating the code to best Swift 2.0 practices.
